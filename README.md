This project aimed to compare the effectiveness of different data augmentation methods in
improving image classification performance, studying their relationship with respect to dataset size and augmentation factor. The proposed approach consisted in evaluating four state-of-the-art data augmentation techniques, i.e. AugMix, CutMix, MixUp and GridMask, on an image classification task employing the ResNet20 Convolutional Neural Network classifier on different downsampled versions of the CIFAR-10 dataset.
